# Learning gawk

## Why awk
工作中经常要很多处理文本的场合，用C++处理简直要吐血，用python处理还是很重，awk就刚刚好，正如它的描述：

> Several kinds of tasks occur repeatedly when working with text files. You might want to extract certain lines and discard the rest. Or you may need to make changes wherever certain patterns appear, but leave the rest of the file alone. Such jobs are often easy with awk. The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that makes it easy to handle simple data-reformatting jobs.

awk的官方文档写得真心好，非常值得一看。
